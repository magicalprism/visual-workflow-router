# First Graph Render

This document outlines the steps required to render the first graph in the visual workflow router application.

## Steps to Render the First Graph

1. **Set Up Graph Component**
   - Create a new component `GraphRenderer.tsx` in the `src/components/Graph` directory.
   - Import necessary libraries such as React and any graph rendering libraries (e.g., D3.js, React Flow).
   - Define the `GraphRenderer` component to accept props for workflow data.

2. **Fetch Workflow Data**
   - Use the API endpoint `/api/generate-workflow` to fetch workflow data.
   - Implement a hook or use `useEffect` to call the API and store the response in the component's state.

3. **Render Graph**
   - Inside the `GraphRenderer` component, use the fetched workflow data to render nodes and edges.
   - Map through the nodes and edges to create visual representations (e.g., circles for nodes and lines for edges).

4. **Add Graph Toolbar**
   - Create a `GraphToolbar` component to provide controls for the graph (e.g., zoom, pan).
   - Integrate the `GraphToolbar` into the `GraphRenderer` component.

5. **Style the Graph**
   - Use the `GraphStyles.module.css` file to define styles for the graph elements.
   - Ensure that nodes and edges are visually distinct and properly aligned.

6. **Test the Graph Rendering**
   - Write tests in `tests/graph.render.test.tsx` to verify that the graph renders correctly with various workflow data inputs.
   - Ensure that the graph updates when new data is fetched.

7. **Integrate with Minimal UI**
   - Use the `MinimalUI` component to allow users to add nodes and connect edges interactively.
   - Ensure that changes in the UI reflect in the graph rendering.

8. **Document the Graph Rendering**
   - Update the README.md file with instructions on how to use the graph rendering feature.
   - Include examples of workflow data and expected graph outputs.

By following these steps, you will successfully render the first graph in the visual workflow router application, providing a foundational feature for visualizing workflows.
